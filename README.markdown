# Hue Thief

Factory reset Philips Hue bulbs using an EZSP-based Zigbee USB stick. After a reset, bulbs can easily join any type of compatible bridge.


## EZSP-based Zigbee USB sticks

These are devices based on a Silicon Labs EM351, EM357 or EM358 chip that communicates with the host PC using the EZSP protocol over a virtual COM port. Which protocol is used depends on which firmware is flashed.

- Silicon Labs/Linear/Nortek/GoControl HubZ/QuickStick Combo (HUSBZB-1)/Elelabs Raspberry Pi shield and USB adapter. These devices should come with an EZSP firmware preloaded.
- Home Assistant Skyconnect. Reportedly also works, and comes with the right EZSP firmware preloaded.
- Silicon Labs/Telegesis ETRX357USB/ETRX3USB/ETRX3. These devices come with an AT-command based firmware preloaded. You may be able to flash it with compatible firmware by doing something like this: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/eu-usb-sticks-for-the-new-zigbee-component/16718/10?u=frank

## Installation

Make sure you have python 3.5 or newer and pip. (`sudo apt-get install python3-pip`)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief
cd hue-thief
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

Bring the bulb(s) you want to factory reset close to your EZSP device. Shutdown any other applications (home assistant, perhaps?) that may be using the EZSP device. Power on the bulb(s) and immediately:

```sh
python3 hue-thief.py /dev/ttyUSB0
```
or if you need to change the baudrate to 115200 for the Home Assistant SkyConnect:
```sh
python3 hue-thief.py /dev/ttyUSB0 --baudrate 115200
```

`/dev/ttyUSB0` should be your EZSP device. You should have full permissions on this device file.

In case you're using Ubuntu on Windows (WSL) you'll want to do something like this, assuming the EZSP device is mapped to COM4:

```sh
sudo python3 hue-thief.py /dev/ttyS4
```

Hue Thief will now scan all Zigbee channels for ZLL-compatible bulbs that are associated with any Zigbee network. When a bulb is found, it will blink a couple of times, and the application will ask if you want to factory reset this bulb. (If you didn't see any blinking, you may be doing your neighbours a favour by choosing 'N' here. :-))

That's it. Your now factory clean bulbs should be discoverable through whatever means your bridge/software offers.

## Docker

If you already have Docker set up, then it's extremely simple to build a `hue-thief` image using the provided `Dockerfile`.

### Docker build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief
cd hue-thief
docker build -t hue-thief .
```

### Docker run

Now that you have built the image, here's what you use every time you want to run it. Alternative devices include ttyUSB0 or ttyAMA0.

```sh
DEV=/dev/ttyUSB1 docker run --rm --device=$DEV:$DEV -it hue-thief python hue-thief/hue-thief.py $DEV
```

This will create a container from the image you built, and run it with the Zigbee device available inside the container.
It will automatically run the hue-thief code from this project, then remove the container on completion. 


### Docker troubleshooting

If you want to run a container with a shell for diagnostics use:

```sh
DEV=/dev/ttyUSB1 docker run --rm --device=$DEV:$DEV -it hue-thief bash
```

A common issue is that the device is already in use by another process. Stop other containers that might be using the Zigbee radio and try again. 


## Problems

I will not be held responsible if you brick any hardware or do other awful things with this. On the bright side: I really don't see how that could ever happen, but still...

This script is kind of a hack, as it tries to implement about a zillion layers of Zigbee protocol in just a few lines of code. :-) So things will only work if everything goes *exactly* according to plan.

If no devices are found, there is no blinking or the factory reset doesn't work, the generated `log.pcap` file should be the first place to look for a clue. (Wireshark has decent Zigbee analyzers, though the ZLL commissioning part is still missing.)
